The link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/uk-bank-customers . 
This dataset consists of 4014 customers' data. The Customer ID, Name, Surname, Gender, Age, Region, Job Classification, Date Joined, and balance are included in this dataset. 

In this project, the customers' data is visualized using Tableau. This analysis provides insights about how customers having different jobs, belonging to various age groups and gender are spread across regions. This helps in converting more customers by reaching the right set of people.

The following are the key takeaways:
* The customers of England are mostly represented by white collar workers(70%). Male and female customers are almost equally distributed and most of them are in their 30s. 
* In Scotland, most of the customers are  men in their late 40s and early 50s. The representation of white color workers is very low.
* Northern Ireland is mostly represented by females in their late 20s and early 30s. 
* In Wales, Male and female customers are almost equally distributed and most of them are in their 30s. 
* Except for Wales, as the balance amount in the bank increases, a gradual decrease in the number of customers can be observed. A large percentage of the customers seem to have a balance below 60,000. 

Therefore, this visualization helps in targeting the potential customers in a given region. From the information gained through the analysis, appropriate ways can be designed to attract people of different ages, gender, and having different types of jobs and belonging to various regions.
